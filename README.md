# MyProjects
Hey! This repository contain my projects, where you can follow my journey learning important things about fullstack development.

Here you can find some React projects I've been working on, in order to refine my abilities in this technology. 
So far, I've developed templates for a ficticious skincare blog, movie review website, and Art Supply online store.
Those are all made up websites, and I do not own the images I've used in it.
All of them were made using also Bootstrap.

Thank you for checking my repository!
